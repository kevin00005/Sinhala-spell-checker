Sinhala Spell Checker and Grammar Checker
Overview
This project focuses on developing a Sinhala Spell Checker and Grammar Checker using advanced natural language processing techniques. The objective is to provide accurate suggestions for correcting spelling mistakes and grammatical errors in Sinhala text.

Features

Spell Checking: Automatically detects and corrects misspelled Sinhala words.
Grammar Checking: Identifies grammatical errors and suggests corrections for sentence structure and syntax.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture built with TensorFlow/Keras.

Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the model.
NumPy for numerical computations.
Python-docx for handling Word files.

How It Works
Input: Raw Sinhala text containing potential spelling and grammatical errors.
Preprocessing: The text undergoes tokenization, where each word is broken down into sequences of characters.
Model Training: Using a Seq2Seq model, the system is trained to predict the correct spelling and grammar for each sequence.
Output: The model provides the corrected text with suggested improvements.

Model Details
Architecture: Sequence-to-Sequence model comprising of:
Embedding layer to transform characters into dense vectors.
LSTM layers for processing the sequence data.
Dense output layer with softmax activation for generating corrected text.
Training Data: The model is trained on a dataset of correctly spelled Sinhala words along with their misspelled counterparts, ensuring robustness in identifying errors.
Dataset
The training data includes a mix of correct and incorrect Sinhala words.
The dataset is preprocessed to handle noise such as numerical values, special characters, and irrelevant data.
Installation
To run the spell and grammar checker, follow these steps:



2. Grammar Checking:
Extend the functionality to handle entire sentences for grammar improvements.

Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! Whether it's improving the accuracy of the model, expanding the dataset, or adding new features, your input is highly valued.

Future Work
Enhanced Grammar Suggestions: Incorporating advanced syntactic and semantic analysis for complex grammar issues.
Contextual Spell Checking: Leveraging contextual information to improve spell-check accuracy for sentences.
UI Integration: Building a user-friendly interface (e.g., web app, mobile app) for real-time corrections.
